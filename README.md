# Tutorials
Creating tutorials for things with poorly written instructions.

### 1. BitBucket Setup Guide
**Detailed guide for beginners that walks them through the process of creating a BitBucket repository.**

This was originally created out of frustration during a particularly annoying college course.

### 2. Minecraft Server Hosting - Port Forwarding with Metronet & Eero Router
**A guide that shows Metronet users who are unfamiliar with server management how to open a port on your Eero router and host a server.**

As a kid I'd always been interested in server hosting, but never had the opportunity to purchase hardware or communicate with my ISP. 
Now that I'm an adult, I decided to finally accomplish this seemingly simple task, but was surprised at the lack of information for port forwarding on Eero routers. Metronet, my ISP, also doesn't provide any resources about port forwarding. This site I've created is an accumulation of about a months worth of work into about 20 minutes of a guide.
