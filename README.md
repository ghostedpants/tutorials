**2. Minecraft Server Hosting: Port Forwarding with Metronet & Eero Routers**\
*A guide that shows Metronet users who are unfamiliar with server management how to open a port on your Eero router and host a server.*

Contains the following content:
* Definitions of common terms used throughout the guide.
* Shows the user how to open ports inside the Eero mobile application.

As a kid I'd always been interested in server hosting, but never had the opportunity to purchase hardware or communicate with my ISP. 
Now that I'm an adult, I decided to finally accomplish this seemingly simple task, but was surprised at the lack of information for port forwarding on Eero routers. Metronet, my ISP, also doesn't provide any resources about port forwarding. This site I've created is an accumulation of about a months worth of work into about 20 minutes of a guide.
